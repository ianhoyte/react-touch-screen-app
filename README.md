## About

This is a react based app that uses [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) to request JSON responses from the client's [Concrete5](http://www.concrete5.org) website. Custom endpoints were created on the C5 install to respond with listing data so the client only has to update their website and this app will update accordingly.

## Installation

* `npm i` installs the dependencies
* `npm start` starts the project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and is licensed under the terms of the GNU GPLv3.
